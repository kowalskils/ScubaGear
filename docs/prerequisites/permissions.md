# Permissions

ScubaGear can be invoked interactively or non-interactively. 

* **Interactive mode** simply means that the user will be prompted for the credentials that are required by the underlying Microsoft libraries. Certain user and application permissions are required to execute ScubaGear this way. Collectively, they are referred to as the [interactive permissions](interactive.md).

* **Non-interactive mode** means that the credentials that are required by the underlying Microsoft libraries are supplied via command-line parameters or the config file. Only one type of permission, [non-interactive permissions](noninteractive.md), are required to execute ScubaGear this way.
